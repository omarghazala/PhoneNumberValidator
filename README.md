Phone Number Validator Application

- This is a full stack application using Angular for Front-end and Spring-Boot for the Back-end 
- The app is still not dockerized since I  am facing some issues with my docker enviroment
- you can listen to the front end at "http://localhost:4200/" and the backend at "http://localhost:8080/"
